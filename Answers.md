1. What is React JS? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?
    <p>React JS is a JavaScript framework that takes advantage of reusable pieces of UI called components and a uni-directional flow of data. Components are made of JS classes and gives developers the power to write UI with both JS and HTML. React differs from other JS frameworks in that it uses a Virtual DOM to store a version of the DOM and only updates nodes that have changed. Therefore React is best used in applications that have many costly DOM operations. React can also make changes to different areas of a app without refreshing the page.</p>
